# comp472-MP3
My repository for the third Mini project for COMP-472

Instructions for running the experiment:

1. Make sure the Gensim library is installed on your machine. To install, type "pip install --upgrade gensim" in the console.
2. Place the synonyms.csv file in the same folder as the WordEmbedding.py script. The program will run into errors if this file is not available.
3. Navigate in your console to the folder that contains synonyms.csv and WordEmbedding.py by typing "cd <filepath>".
4. Run the script by typing "python WordEmbedding.py" in the console.

NOTE: This script may install some pre-trained models from the Gensim library if they are not already installed on your machine.  
  Please be patient as the script may take a few moments to run.
